# Recipe Spellbook LLC
*An organization building free and open source tools for managing your kitchen*

---

## The mission
Our original goal for Recipe Spellbook was to be a personal use application for one of the founders to keep track of their recipes, built in Prolog, his favorite language. However, this goal was not interesting enough to really entice us so we set out to create something bigger, something with merit, something that would benefit the community as a whole. Our mission is to create a set of open standards for all of your food notekeeping needs, for example:
- Storing recipes.
- Calculating and recording calories and other macros.
- Write out weekly mealplans and grocery lists.
- Create and share "cookbooks" with other users.
This is all well and good however, there is one more lofty goal we plan to include: decentralization. I know its a spooky buzzword however we find it important that you as a user can access your data from anywhere without giving that data to us the organization. I won't say we will be perfect, I mean the initial models will be written in Prolog, however our plan is to do our best to please you, the user.

## The framework

Due to the nature of our goal it is important we outline what moving parts there are to this system, so here is each one:

- [#](Recipe format standard)
- [#](User to Server API)
- [#](Server to Server API)

## The examples

Here is a curated list of examples that we have made for you

- [#](Some Client written in Prolog)
- [#](Some Server written in Prolog)

- [#](Some Client written in Javascript)
- [#](Some Server written in Rust)

## The community

Because our goal is to serve the community we have a few ways to do this

- [#](Some matrix server)
- [#](Some email)
